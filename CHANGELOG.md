## Unreleased

## v2.3.0 - 2026-07-31

### Added in v2.3.0

- Added the six canonical rule files and schema 3 source provenance as tracked
  starter-kit content.

### Changed in v2.3.0

- Updated the autonomous workflow to use the synchronization engine owned by
  `agent-coding-rules` and to preserve repository-specific rule files.
- Changed release packages to validate and include tracked rule files instead
  of overlaying a second source checkout during the build.

### Removed in v2.3.0

- Removed `coding-agent-toolchain` from the rule synchronization path.
- Removed source-repository GitHub App authentication from package builds.

## v2.2.1 - 2026-07-31

### Fixed in v2.2.1

- Provisioned pinned Go and Shfmt releases before the hosted static audit.

## v2.2.0 - 2026-07-31

### Added in v2.2.0

- Added canonical text digests and content kinds to managed-file manifests.
- Added three-way merge payloads and durable adoption state for customized
  merge-managed files.
- Added a universal per-repository workflow for autonomous agent-rule update
  pull requests without a central consumer registry.

### Changed in v2.2.0

- Delegated the six root agent-rule files and their provenance to each target
  repository's autonomous rule synchronization workflow.
- Reported changed initialization-only files as explicit local-review actions
  without blocking or writing the target repository.
- Preserved repository-specific skill, release, file-inventory, tool
  documentation, and audit logic as initialization-only during cumulative
  upgrades.
- Limited upgrade toolkit publication to `git-starter-kit`; downstream release
  workflows now publish only their enriched repository package.

### Fixed in v2.2.0

- Targeted the published `coding-agent-toolchain v1.6.1` release from the
  autonomous agent-rule update workflow.
- Compared starter provenance semantically so agent-rule updates and
  newline-only changes cannot invalidate a proven starter baseline.
- Normalized the Bash initialization script to the enforced Shfmt layout and
  added that check to static and read-only repository audits.
- Preserved unrelated untracked files while continuing to block tracked
  worktree changes, missing managed files, and merge conflicts.

## v2.1.4 - 2026-07-30

### Fixed in v2.1.4

- Excluded a previously tracked managed-file manifest before regenerating
  package metadata, so aligned downstream repositories can build exhaustive
  release packages.
- Marked literal workflow-pattern checks explicitly so ShellCheck validates
  the repository audit script without false expansion warnings.

## v2.1.3 - 2026-07-30

### Fixed in v2.1.3

- Classified release documentation for three-way merge and repository
  migration records as initialization-only so cumulative upgrades cannot
  replace downstream-specific documentation.

## v2.1.2 - 2026-07-30

### Fixed in v2.1.2

- Derived upgrade toolkit names from the packaged repository in reusable
  release workflows instead of retaining the `git-starter-kit` prefix in
  downstream repositories.

## v2.1.1 - 2026-07-30

### Fixed in v2.1.1

- Included dotfiles and files below dot-directories in managed-file manifests
  on Linux release runners, and made archive coverage mismatches fail package
  generation.

## v2.1.0 - 2026-07-30

### Added in v2.1.0

- Git-aware staged ZIP backup tooling with focused Python tests, shared audit
  coverage, operational documentation, and repository inventory entries.
- Cumulative starter-kit upgrade tooling with per-file hash comparison,
  provenance gates, conflict reporting, external rollback archives, focused
  tests, and a reusable release toolkit.

### Changed in v2.1.0

- Added a portable Markdownlint baseline and recorded managed-file hashes,
  modes, ownership strategies, repository identity, starter-kit provenance,
  and agent-rules provenance in composed release packages.
- Made release package naming and provenance reusable by downstream
  repositories while preserving `StarterRef` as a compatibility alias.
- Required the automatic release workflow to validate composed Markdown and
  spelling content before uploading the full package and upgrade toolkit.

### Fixed in v2.1.0

- Kept verbose Git traces separate from captured command output in Bash and
  PowerShell repository initialization.
- Accepted the valid Rust term `statics` in the shared spelling policy so
  packages enriched with agent rules pass Codespell.

## v2.0.3 - 2026-07-23

### Added in v2.0.3

- Repository-scoped skills documentation in `docs/SKILLS.md`, generated from
  authoritative skill sources and registered in the repository file
  inventory.

## v2.0.2 - 2026-07-21

### Fixed in v2.0.2

- Supplied explicit repository context when the release promotion job invokes
  GitHub CLI without a local checkout.

## v2.0.1 - 2026-07-21

### Changed in v2.0.1

- Made GitHub Releases start as prereleases and become stable only after the
  automatic `Release package` workflow succeeds.
- Required the canonical skill workflow to identify and verify the exact
  release-triggered CI run and packaged asset before reporting completion.

### Fixed in v2.0.1

- Authenticated cross-repository agent-rules release resolution with a
  read-only GitHub App installation token to avoid anonymous REST API rate
  limits in release-package workflows.

## v2.0.0 - 2026-07-21

### Added in v2.0.0

- Canonical reference instructions for guarded SemVer analysis, commit, tag,
  atomic push, synchronization checks, and optional template-based GitHub
  Release publication.

### Changed in v2.0.0

- Replaced the inline `git-commit-push-tag` workflow with the canonical
  reference as its sole behavioral source of truth.
- Made invocations without an explicit `BUMP` stop after reporting the
  recommended bump and tag, before any repository mutation.
- Aligned skill metadata and repository documentation with the canonical
  workflow and its explicit GitHub Release gate.

  operating guidance for the repository migration from Google Drive to local
  NTFS storage.

### Added in v1.8.0

- Optional non-mutating repository audit profile using installed tools without
  package installation, network access, temporary files, or mutating smoke
  tests.
- Windows mitigation guidance for the external Codex Git process issue.
- Annotated-tag policy for new releases, with documented lightweight
  historical exceptions.

### Changed in v1.8.0

- Preserved the full repository audit as the default behavior and added
  `full` as an explicit alias.
- Made new release tag creation consistently use annotated tags.

### Fixed in v1.8.0

- Corrected the Git commit, push, and tag skill agent YAML metadata.
- Guarded full-audit temporary cleanup against unexpected paths.
- Preserved read-only PowerShell parsing when Windows PowerShell is called
  from WSL.
